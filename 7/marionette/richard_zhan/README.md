Deleting games from the collection does not work

I tried various ways (the finalized nonworking version is a mixture of me playing around and Alex Libman's code)

I intended to have a view with a collection of my games and another view for everyone else's games for a potluck board game thing, but all my time was allocated to getting delete to work.

Not sure if this is considered 'less' than the three word story thing.
