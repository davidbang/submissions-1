	<h2>Why?</h2>
	<a href = "compare">Compare Schools</a><br><br>
	Noticing that certain schools in the data are all capitalized and some are not, we decided to see whether the case of the school's name makes a difference in the score. Mr. Dyrland-Weaver, seeing this, suggested to us to also analyze whether the length of the school's name will also affect the score. And I, Sean, just wanted to, for teh lolz.
