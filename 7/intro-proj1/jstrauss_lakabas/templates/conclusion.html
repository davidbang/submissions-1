<h3> Conclusion: </h3>After we had finished with our code, we saw that the results of our project generally created the same ranking order of the People's Choice Ranking order. However, there were exceptions. For example, Bill Russell, who was ranked by the People's Choice Ranking as the 3rd best player of all time. However, after factoring in the Career Efficiency Value, Bill Russell ended up as 27th on our modified list. His Efficiency ranking was 67, far from his People's Choice Ranking. The Efficiency is a composite basketball statistic that theoretically shows how good the player is. However, this rating is criticized for not fairly weighing the defensive contribution as much as the offensive contribution of a player. Bill Russell has been regarded as the greatest defensive player in the history of the NBA, so our results have supported the criticism of the unbalance of offensive and defensive contributions of the player. Eventually, the NBA might be able to come up with a better way to produce a ranking system.
