<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>What I attempted to do here was to examine human kind's carbon emissions and see/validate whether we are putting more C into the atmosphere, faster. I first made a table of the amount of change between every two years. One of the major difficulties I had was numerous conversions of data from "str" form to "int" form. I also had difficulties in printing the year ranges as one box in the table even though they came from seperate boxes in the first data.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
The Analysis being done here is only on the first column of data after the date column in the data portion, it deals with the "Total carbon emissions from fossil-fuels (million metric tons of C)". What my analysis does is examine the amount of carbon emiisions between every two years. The first thing you see on this page is the table of the data that I extracted. I also graphed the data in excel and included it. Below the excel graph is a graph of the data from the table, each  "=" sign is a million metric tons of C and it is showing how much the emmissions went up (or down) every two years. What I have found is a known, but sad truth: Not only is there more C in the atmosphere thean there has ever been, we are putting it into the atmosphere faster. That is a very disturbing fact. Finally, I had a pretty tought problem with Filezilla. It wouldn't let me transfer any files to marge, when I would try the file would appear as an empty file on marge which was extremely aggravating. Finally, I figured it out. In my room, where I work, I have my own router that extends the signal of the main raouter in the living room. For some reason Filezilla does not like this extra jump. The solution to this problem was all too simple. All I had to do was work from the living room. Solved.</p>
