<body>
  Our data compares how different students from different states in the United States do on the SAT and ACT test.The reason why we chose to analyze this data was because there are always debates (although many are not serious) about which states are smarter, which states have brighter students, etc.In addition, it is interesting to read about these SAT scores and ACT scores in an organized matter because the SATs are something that has encompassed us in junior year.<br><br>
