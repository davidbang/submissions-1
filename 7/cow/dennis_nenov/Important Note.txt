I was absent the day this project was introduced, so I missed the lesson that day; though I understand that's not necessarily a valid excuse, I ended up having to look at the code of another group--Matthew and Terrence in Period 6--in order to create my project. I plan on dramatically improving this project in the coming days, and coming up with my own, unique solution.
