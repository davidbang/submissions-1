    Start drawing lines and from those lines an LSystem was supposed to be generated. The ideas was to make the system based on an initial drawing rather than inputting initial values. But I couldn't get the slopes to loop back around, so they'd just go offscreen rather than forming a pattern. Instead I just set some parameters really high to at least make fairly cool shapes. I'll get these things to work eventually.
