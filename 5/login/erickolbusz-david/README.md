About the Project<br>
Anyone can visit this page, you do not have to be logged in or anything of that sort, though you can be if you choose to.
Now to talk about this project.
It is a simple account manager. A person must register on the register page and then login on the login page
to access the Welcome and About me pages. Usernames cannot be duplicated and require 6 characters minimum and a 8 character password.
The Welcome page just tells you your username and the number of times you have logged in.
The About me page lets you write whatever you want. You can write about yourself or about anything that is on your mind.
The About the project page has the same thing as this text.
The info will be recorded and stored in the database and can never be deleted from your account.
The Logout link in the menu lets you log out whenever you want.
The least important page is the Random page which will have something super random on it. Anyone can access it.
