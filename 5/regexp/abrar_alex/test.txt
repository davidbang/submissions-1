Although crowds of pro-democracy protesters swelled further here on Wednesday, a national holiday, Hong Kong’s chief executive and his inner core of advisers have decided, with support from China’s leaders, that their best strategy is to wait and hope that the disruption of everyday life will turn local public opinion against the demonstrators.

Leung Chun-ying, the chief executive, and his advisers have decided not to use force to disperse the demonstrations but also not to hold formal negotiations with protest leaders for now, said people with a detailed knowledge of the Hong Kong government’s and Beijing’s policies. Nor has there been any serious discussion of Mr. Leung’s resigning, as the protesters, who number in the tens of thousands and have blocked three major thoroughfares for days, are demanding.

    Hong Kong Leader Reacts to ProtestsSEPT. 30, 2014

As night fell Wednesday, the streets of downtown Hong Kong filled with what appeared to be the biggest crowd since the protests began. Mostly teenagers and adults in their 20s, they were in a festive mood, many taking pictures of each other or writing notes about why they were demonstrating, which they affixed to an outer wall of the Hong Kong government’s headquarters.

What Prompted the Hong Kong Protests?

Hong Kong belongs to China and operates under a policy of “one country, two systems.”

    Hong Kong, a British colony until 1997, when China resumed sovereignty, is governed by a mini-constitution, the Basic Law.

    The city maintains an independent judiciary, and residents enjoy greater civil liberties than residents of mainland China. Hong Kong has a robust tradition of free speech.

    Democratic groups say Beijing has chipped away at those freedoms, citing an election law proposed last month that would limit voting reforms.

    China had promised free elections for Hong Kong's chief executive in 2017. But the government rejected a call for open nominations, instead proposing that candidates would continue to be chosen by a committee dominated by Beijing.

    The current city leader, Leung Chun-ying, has clashed with the pro-democracy opposition. After the crackdown on protesters Sunday, some called for his resignation.

The city’s leadership has concluded that it would be pointless for Mr. Leung to sit down with protest leaders, although a few informal contacts have been made with democracy advocates, and a few of Mr. Leung’s friends have recommended actual negotiations. Beijing has given the Hong Kong government only a little room to negotiate the details of how the next chief executive will be elected in 2017 — the fundamental issue for the demonstrators.

“The government can tolerate the blockade of three or four or five areas and see how the demonstrations go, so the only way the demonstrators can go is to escalate it — spread it to more places, and then they cannot sustain it — or they will become violent,” said a person who is deeply involved in the Hong Kong government’s decision-making.

If the demonstrators do become violent, the person added, “they know better than we do that they will lose support overnight.” Like others interviewed about the government’s intentions, he insisted on anonymity because he was not authorized to speak with journalists.

An adviser to the government also said that officials’ emerging view was that Mr. Leung should bide his time. “The consensus is to wait and patiently deal with the crisis — it is not easy, but we shall do our best to resolve it peacefully,” the adviser said.

    Room for Debate: What Autonomy MeansSEPT. 29, 2014

The strategy carries risks, for both the local and the national governments, because it in effect cedes momentum to the protesters and allows them to drive events going forward. For China, continuing protests could inspire more dissent on the mainland, despite its censors’ attempts to block discussion of the events. Chinese Human Rights Defenders, an advocacy group, said Wednesday that China had already detained or intimidated dozens of people for perceived transgressions like expressing support for the protesters on social media.

For the Hong Kong government, the risk is that the city’s image as a stable financial center will be harmed and that the government’s intransigence, rather than the protesters’ actions, will be blamed for the short-term economic disruption.

Chan Kin-man, a co-founder of one of the main protest groups, Occupy Central With Love and Peace, said at a news conference Wednesday that Mr. Leung would not outlast the demonstrators.

“If he believes that if he keeps on dragging on without answering to our demands then people will go away, forget about it,” said Mr. Chan, who added that protesters would be willing to skip work to remain in the streets. “If they are not afraid of tear gas, I don’t think they will be afraid of their supervisors and bosses,” he said.

A student protest leader, Lester Shum, said Wednesday that students were prepared to occupy government buildings if their demands were not met, repeating a threat made Tuesday by another student leader. But Mr. Chan openly questioned that idea, saying that the demonstrators could find themselves spread too thin.

The leaders of the demonstrators have repeatedly insisted that they will only pursue nonviolent civil disobedience. In terms of public opinion, violence would be risky for either side: When the outnumbered police resorted to tear gas on Sunday night, they provoked widespread anger, and more people came to protest on Monday.

Map: Areas of Protest in Hong Kong

The lack of a cohesive leadership among the protesters, who are divided into factions, combined with the ambitious nature of their demands — fully open elections for Mr. Leung’s successor, as well as his resignation — have prompted Hong Kong officials to conclude that the protest leaders are unlikely to accept half-measures in any negotiations.

And even if the protest leaders do agree to the fairly narrow compromises that Beijing is willing to discuss, the government has concluded that they are unlikely to be able to persuade demonstrators to go home.

The wait-them-out strategy appears to have the support of the city’s influential tycoons, many of whom are out of town during this holiday week in any case. The tycoons derive the bulk of their income from leasing out their many commercial, office and residential properties, and their tenants have to keep paying Hong Kong’s famously high rents even as protesters restrict access to many businesses.

The hope of the Hong Kong government, and of Beijing, is that this economic pressure will turn owners of small businesses and other members of the middle class against the demonstrators. Local officials hope that the public will come to see the protesters as people who inconvenience others, not as icons of democracy, as the students occupying Tiananmen Square in Beijing became in 1989 before China’s brutal crackdown.

“This is a Cultural Revolution revival, this is not Tiananmen — they think they are doing the right thing, so they can infringe on other people’s interests and therefore make the government kowtow to them,” said the person heavily involved in the government’s decision-making.

The government adviser said officials were actively trying to avoid a Tiananmen-style crackdown. “We cannot repeat the mistake of 25 years ago,” the adviser said.

One crucial question is how much patience Beijing has. There was a hint of impatience in an editorial Wednesday in People’s Daily, the main Communist Party newspaper, which called for the Hong Kong community to “support the Hong Kong police’s decisive law enforcement, to restore social order in Hong Kong as soon as possible.”

But Beijing officials have shown far more self-confidence in dealing with local protests around China than they did five or 10 years ago. Faced with literally thousands of local protests around China each year involving issues like the construction of chemical plants, unpaid wages and other issues, Beijing has become more accustomed to letting local governments try to strike many kinds of compromises.

At the same time, Beijing has focused censorship and the efforts of security forces on making sure that people elsewhere in China either do not hear about such protests, or else are detained or intimidated if they try to stage copycat events.

The central authorities in Beijing have allowed Hong Kong officials to manage the political crisis here as long as they do not promise fundamental changes in how the next chief executive is chosen in 2017. The Hong Kong government has been mulling, with Beijing’s support, a small compromise that might allow democracy supporters to say later that they had achieved something.

Beijing has mandated that while all adults will be allowed to vote in 2017, only names approved by a nomination committee will be allowed on the ballot. The nomination committee is to be drawn in equal shares from four sectors of society; one of these, for example, is the “industrial, commercial and financial sector,” which tends to be dominated by pro-Beijing tycoons.

The Hong Kong government is willing to broaden the number of people who participate in each sector’s selection of delegates, said the person heavily involved in local decision-making. But while a few pro-democracy politicians have been willing to discuss such a change, there has been no such interest from protesters. They mainly want the general public to be allowed to nominate candidates, an idea that officials have firmly ruled out.
