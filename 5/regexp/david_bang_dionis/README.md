Name Identifier
===============
User Friendly Name Identifier.
Run the py file in terminal. 
The intial printout will be a list of all name types (including repeats)
Then you will be prompt to choose a specific name id function
After choosing, you will choose which file to scan through

Note*= Functions are not perfect and still have bugs
The main problem is that many names may only be first names, but then this opens up alot of room for error
