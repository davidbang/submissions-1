  <center><h1>An Intense Examination of Pokemon Statistics Based on Type</h1>
  <center><p>
    We, being children and having our tastes and opinions heavily dependent on the influence of virtual media have decided to use this project as an opportunity to analyze the Great American Passtime: Pokemon. Below, you will find a number of graphs comparing the statistics of a number of different types of Pokemon found in the first two generations made available. We acknowledge that this is but a small and seemingly random sample of an immense field of data, and would like to see this project furthered in the future through the addition of features allowing for user interaction with the data made available, which would allow for the full range of the data we have assembled to be put to use. 

*Please Note: The Pokemon First Type Indicated By Each Graph's Title Is Represented By Green Dots, While The Second Type in the Title Is Represented By Red Dots, And The Y-Axis Is Used To Represent The Overall Stat Values Of Each Individual Pokemon.*
