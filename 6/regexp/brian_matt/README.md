<h1> Regex Name Finder </h1>
by Brian and Matt 

<h2>How to use:</h2> 

Run in your terminal by issuing this command:
<br>
<br>
```
    python findnames.py <filename without extension>
```
    
For example, if your test file was testtext.txt, you would run this:
```
    python findnames.py testtext
```

NOTE: Names with Mr. and Mrs. are kept by our name finder.<br>
NOTE: There may be false positives with proper nouns which are not composed of two or more english words.
   e.g. "The Secret Service" would not be considered a name, but "Cenozoic Era" would.
