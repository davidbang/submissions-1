		<h1><center>Fill the Buckets by Justin Strauss</center></h1>
		<b>How to play:</b> Click the button to release drops of water into the moving buckets. Pay attention to the timer in the upper right hand corner. If you fail to release a drop every five seconds, a point is deducted. Every time you make it into a bucket, you earn a point. If the drop misses all buckets and falls off the bottom of the screen, you lose a point. The game is over once one of the buckets overflows. The number of points diplayed is your final score. <br><br>
