		<h1>Fill the Buckets by Justin Strauss</h1>
		<b>How to play:</b> Click above the line to release drops of water. Every time a drop lands in a moving bucket, you earn a point. If the drop misses all buckets and falls off the bottom of the screen, you lose a point. <br> The game is over once one of the buckets overflows by being hit by a drop of water when it has already turned blue. Keep in mind that the highest attainable score is 10.<br><br>
