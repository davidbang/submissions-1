This is the plan:
- 10.30.14: do some of the mongo stuff
  - add username and password
  - check username and password
- 10.31.14-11.2.14: finish the web app stuff
  - create the other pages (mostly html/jinga stuff)
  - getting info from the fields/ making sure the mongo stuff can work
  - moving between pages and remembering that you're logged in
