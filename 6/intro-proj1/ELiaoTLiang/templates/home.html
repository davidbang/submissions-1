    <br>
    Chosen because...<br>
    Eric is an avid Osu player. Somewhat competitive, he's 10x better than the avg player
    while being 10000x worse than the ranked players. <br>
    <br>
    About Osu:<br>
    Osu's a rhythm game based on beats in a song. Basically, hit all the circles,
    and slide wherever needed. The mouse is used for Osu on the
    computer, while tapping is used on mobile platforms, e.g. Osu!droid. <br>All games
    that the Japanese invent are challenging on their hardest levels, hence his
    somewhat love for these games.
    <br><br>
    Here's a video, to clarify what Osu is.<br>
    It's just one of the many insane beatmaps. <br>
