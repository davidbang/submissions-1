We read through a large portion of Flask documentation as well as stack overflow responses in order to incorporate Flask, while 
trying to preserve the basic original functionality of the website.

However, despite reading through a large deal of the documentation, and having what we though was a solid understanding of the class examples, 
we could not quite figure out how to convert our program to Flask correctly while still preserving the structure and function of the website.

We felt we had a decent grasp of the basic Flask functionality we could not seem to understand how to properly pass data from a checklist specifically
to the server to be displayed on the next page that the user is routed too. The one method we thought would work based on our reading was swapping
the values and names, so every checkbox name was different. This would have required a great deal of repetitive try statements that seemed unnecessary
and inefficient, and especially not in line with what we were trying to acheive for this project. 

We would love some help as we feel fairly lost, and are not entirely sure how to proceed.

I went back to my code from yesterday and “fixed” it by circumventing the check boxes -Adam
