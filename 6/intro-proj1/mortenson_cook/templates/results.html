    Once I had converted the raw data into a python dictionary, the biggest difficulty in analyzing the data was
    showing that the data is significant and that there are trends in it.
    I knew right away that there were trends after graphing the raw data in Microsoft Office Excel and having trendlines drawn.
    When viewed as just numbers, however, my data looked pretty meaningless. The problem dictated how I analyzed the data.
    What I ended up doing was creating a list of lists to hold each data set. Each small list had three elements: A given average age, 
    the average number of runs scored or allowed per game by all teams that shared that average player age, and the number of times that average age occured.
    From this, I was able to extract meaningful data by displaying the average number of runs scored or allowed by teams with certian average ages.
    The average ages I did display data from ended up being determined by number of times that average age occured.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 5em;">
    Upon revising the page, I had to change a lot in order to make the raw data sortable. To start with,
    I added the year and team name to my data and simplified the data by combining the two data sets into one.
    This way, there was only one form and one table, and there were no issues with one data table being reset every time the other is sorted.
    Once I had condensed the two data sets into one, the filters were fairly simple,
    but the sorting function required some thought and a lot of tweaking.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 5em;">
    As a note, the raw data value of average player age is weighted based on how much each person played. For example, a 20-year-old rookie
    who only played in 30 of 162 games would count less towards a team's average age than a 35-year-old vet who played in all 162 games.
    This was not done by me, but by the providers of the raw data.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 5em;">
    The processed data seen here displays the overall average number of runs per game scored by all teams with a given average hitter age,
    as well as the overall average number of runs per game allowed by teams with a given average pitcher age.
    For the sake of precision, data is only included from average ages that occur 8 or more times in teams in the raw data set,
    so that teams like the 1998 Florida Marlins, whose young yet terrible pitching staff gave up an average of 5.70 runs per game 
    while being the only pitching staff in the last 20 years to have an average age of 24.5 years old, don't throw off the data too much.
    For example, if there are 12 teams in the data set with an average hitter age of 28.3 years old, the average number of runs scored per game
    by each of those teams is displayed next to the number 28.3. However, if there are only 5 teams in the data set with an average hitter age of 31.4 years old,
    there will be no data displayed for teams with average hitter ages of 31.4 years old.

    This table shows how the average age of a team's pitchers affects the number of runs scored against them in a game. Looking closely, 
    one can notice a general trend; the older the pitchers, the fewer runs a team gives up. While teams with an average pitcher age of between 28 and 30 
    display no obvious trends, the oldest and youngest teams do. While teams whose average pitcher is under the age of 28 give up somewhere between
    4.7 and 4.9 runs on average, teams whose average pitcher is older than 30 give up between 4.3 and 4.6 runs per game on average, significantly fewer.

    With batters, a similar trend can be observed. This time, however, it is much more clear. With a few exceptions, the typical team with an average batter age of
    younger than 29 score an average of <b>fewer</b> than 4.8 runs per game. Typical teams with an average batter age of older than 29, with suprisingly few exceptions,
    average 4.8 <b>or more</b> runs per game. This trend is much more apparent than the trend amongst pitchers.

    <p style="text-indent: 5em;">
    While these tables show trends with different levels of clarity, the trends are consistent with each other;
    older teams tend to give up fewer runs and score more runs than younger ones, meaning that while it is frustrating that the Yankees have
    so few young, exciting players, their age may be a good thing rather than a bad thing. While a gutsy rookie may be more interesting to watch
    than a knowlegable veteran past his prime, experience is more valuable than youth in baseball. As Yogi Berra famously said,
    "Baseball is 90% mental, the other half is physical," and though a 25-year-old rookie may be more athletic than his 40-year old self,
    He will always learn more about the game and grow more mentally prepared as he gets older and continues to play.
