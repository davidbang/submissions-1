                    <strong>How My Exploration Evolved</strong><br>
                    I began this project thinking I would simply use the given data, manipulate it, <br>
                    and add it what I already knew about a few players.<br>
                    In fact, I learned more than I thought I would.<br>
                    I made connections between what I knew and my analyzed data.<br>
                    I learned something new not just about a few players, but about countries and players in general.<br><br>
                    <strong>Obstacles</strong> <br>
                    When I downloaded the original data, it opened in Adobe.<br>
                    The only usable format I could convert it to was .txt.<br>
                    However, the txt file had several issues with that made it difficult to use.<br>
                    For example, Adobe misalligned the headings of the table and the page number of the Adobe version was in the txt file.<br>
                    I manually fixed the heading errors and used Python to skip the page numbers and empty lines.

          <h3>Summary</h3>
          <p>
        There are several great tennis players from Spain, so I was not surprised to see Spain in first place.<br>
        However, I was surprised by the overall rankings by country.<br>
        USA is in fifth, despite having only a few great players (such as John Isner).<br>
        In the 2012 Olympics Tennis Finals, Murray (GBR) defeated Federer (SUI).<br>
        However, GBR is only in eighth place and SUI is only in seventh.<br>
        Also, I was very surprised to see FRA in second, although it made more sense <br>
        when I remembered that Tsonga plays for FRA.<br>
        I also noticed that there are exactly 100 countries represented in the ATP Rankings.<br>
        I'm not sure if this is a coincidence or not.<br>
        I learned something new from the second analyzed data table as well:<br>
        Grand Slams do not play as significant a role in a player's total points as I thought.<br>
        The first fifteen players (the best players) attend more Grand Slam and Masters 1000 tournaments than others<br>
        Most of the other players get the majority of their points from other tournaments.<br>
        Even within the best fifteen players, only five of them have Grand Slam as their majority.<br>
        Four of these five players are the top four players. <br>
